# Lab Task-5: Isolated Word Morphological Analysis

In this lab task, Isolated Word Morphological Analysis has been done on the two languages, Hindi and Urdu.

### Word Morphological 
Morphology is the study of words and their parts. Morphemes, like prefixes, suffixes and base words, are defined as the smallest meaningful units of meaning. Morphemes are important for phonics in both reading and spelling, as well as in vocabulary and comprehension.

### Morphological Analysis
Morphological analysis (MA) is a method for identifying, structuring and investigating the total set of possible relationships contained in a given multidimensional problem complex. MA allows small groups of subject specialists to define, link, and internally evaluate the parameters of complex problem spaces, creating a solution space and a flexible inference model

### Dataset used
http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/hutb_release/

### Tools used
Keras, tensorflow, Keras-Applications, Keras-Preprocessing, PyYAML, matplotlib, scikit-learn
  
### File Struture
- In the main directory, you will observe two separate directories for two languages.
- Hindi and Urdu
- In each of the respective directory, there is model and notebook.
- Along with png files of the various curves produced for the two languages.


### Conclusion
-> In the case of Urdu, the val_loss hasn't gone up from 1.25842
-> For hindi, the val_loss hasn't gone up 0.80100
